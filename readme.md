## Project Synopsis
Our web app will have the following features:
* First, a drill scheduler, which will feature a dynamically updating calendar with customizable views of time frames and event details
* Second, a task tracker featuring task creation and viewing with a priority system, racking higher-priority tasks at the top
* And finally, a career planner and work journal to log any personal, career-related to-do's and activities
